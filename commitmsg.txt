feat(admin): implement program attendance, refine account creation, and polish admin UI

Program Attendance
- Add attendance page and Programs link
- Day pills with Today/Completed/Cancelled indicators
- Start/End Time flow: Adjust Time enables inputs; Announce saves and sets as defaults, then locks
- Day Status control (Active/Cancelled)
- Cancellation: inline Reason with right-aligned Announce; toggles to Revert to Active after announcing; shows badge
- Mark Day Completed modal with reason; locks inputs
- Present/Absent only with summary and filled-entries progress
- Toolbar search, status filter, and results count
- Quick mark Present/Absent (applies to filtered), right-aligned on small screens
- Editable Status/Time In/Time Out/Notes; small input heights; autosave indicator

Account Creation (Web Access)
- RTK Query createPendingUser with Bearer token
- Remove password input (temporary backend pass)
- Frontend validation and backend error mapping to fields
- Role options restricted by current user role
- Custom toast for success/error outside modal

Profile Modal and UI Polish
- Restore 3-column; remove Full Name and Role Description
- Fix sidebar overlay; add rounded corners
- Dashboard tab buttons consistent height/active ring
- MixedChart responsive sizing and container width

Routing/Breadcrumbs
- Safe breadcrumb name access and fallback for attendance route

Fixes
- Resolve JSX structure issues and duplicate isLoading in CreateAccountModal
